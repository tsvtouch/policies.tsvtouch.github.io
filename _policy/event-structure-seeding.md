# FIT Event Structure & Seeding Policy

## Purpose of policy

The purpose of this policy is to provide event managers and participants with a uniform process for
determining event structure that removes ambiguity and subjectivity for all FIT events.

## Policy scope and application

This policy applies to all events classified as Tier 1-2 according to the [FIT Event Classification
Policy].

Tier 3 events are bilateral and **do not** require seeding or tournament constructs.

Event managers responsible for delivering Tier 4-5 events are encouraged to adopt this policy in so
far as it is applicable.

## Definitions

Age group
:   an upper or lower date of birth boundary used to distinguish eligibility

Category
:   a gender qualifier used to distinguish eligibility

Division
:   the combination of an age group or open age group with a category

Open age group
:   the absence of an upper or lower date of birth boundary

Round robin
:   a tournament in which each competitor plays in turn against every other

Seeding
:   process of ordering teams based on prior performance in an attempt to equally distribute
    strength across pools

Serpent distribution
:   the process of distributing seeded entities by *snaking* from left to right, down, right to
    left, down, and continuing until all entities are expired.

## Regulatory background

## Policy statement

FIT is committed to ensuring all events provide the opportunity for the best teams to meet in the
finale of every division.

FIT events must have an operating environment where the use of preliminary pools is atypical.
Competing constraints of event duration, available space, number of teams and player welfare
considerations can occassionally encumber this goal. It is in such cases this policy provides the
framework on how to proceed despite these impediments, in line with the FIT objective above.

## FIT event structure & seeding policy

### Structure

It is always preferable that preliminary stages of an event are a round robin of cycle one. If time
permits subsequent cycles may be included on the proviso that all cycles are complete.

-   All events must use the [FIT Tournament Planner] tool to produce a model competition structure
    for each division.
-   The planning tool asks for the following input parameters to determine the model structure:
    -   who are the teams, in seeding order?
    -   how many days of competition are available, including the final series?
    -   what is the daily *maximum* number of games a team may play?
    -   what is the daily *minimum* number of games a team must play?
-   If the planning tool determines that pools are required it will distribute the teams across the
    number of pools using a serpent distribution.
-   No variation to the pools or ordering of matches is to occur -- allowances for extraordinary
    occurences have been factored into draws wherever possible
    -   If one or more teams withdraw any time prior to the start of the competition the model draw
        is to be reproduced using the remaining teams without adjusting any other variables

### Seeding

-   Seeding is to be determined by a team's world ranking 90 days prior to the event commencing
-   The [FIT World Ranking Policy] details the method used to determine world rankings
