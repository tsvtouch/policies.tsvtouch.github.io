# FIT Conflict of Interest Policy

## Purpose of policy

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that actual, potential and perceived conflict of interest
are identified and managed effectively. This policy is aimed at fostering public confidence in the
integrity of the Federation of International Touch (FIT), to protect the integrity of FIT's
decision-making process, to enable our stakeholders to have confidence in the Board's integrity, and
to protect the integrity and reputation of volunteers and committee and sub-committee members.

## Policy scope and application

This policy applies to all individuals at all times in the performance of their duties on behalf of
FIT, including:

-   Board Members, Board Sub-Committee Members, Commissions, and any other working committees or
    reference groups.
-   Volunteers, contractors and consultants.

## Definitions

National Touch Association
:   means an entity recognised under the [FIT Constitution 2011], Rules 11 and 12 as the primary

Perceived conflict of interest

    that may improperly influence the individual's performance of his/her duty to FIT, now or in the
    future.

Potential conflict of interest
:   means it may arise, given the circumstances.

Private interests
:   means personal, professional or business interests that can be direct or indirect, pecuniary
    (financial) or non-pecuniary (non-financial), or a mixture:

    -   Direct interest is held by the individual performing duties on behalf of FIT.
    -   Indirect interest is held by a relative or close associate, for example:
        -   A member of the Board member's immediate family (e.g.  spouse, partner, sibling, child).
        -   A regular member of his/her household.
        -   Another close associate (e.g. friend, relative, business associate).

    -   Non-pecuniary interests are without a financial component where there may be a tendency for
        favouritism or prejudice to arise as a result of personal or family relationships and
        friendships, animosity or other personal involvement with another person or group.

Touch
:   means the sport or game played under the rules determined from time to time by FIT.

## FIT conflict of interest policy

1.  Determining whether a conflict is material
    1.  If a conflict of interest is declared by a Board or Committee member, the Board or Committee
        will determine whether the conflict is material, taking into account a range of factors,
        including:
        -   The issue that is to be discussed and determined by the Board or Committee.
        -   The nature and severity of the conflict (e.g. whether it is real, potential or
            perceived; for pecuniary interests, the quantum, scope and likelihood of the expected
            benefit; and the degree to which the interest could compromise the Board or Committee
            members ability to make an impartial decision in the public interest).
        -   The likelihood that the public will perceive that a conflict of interest exists, and the
            extent to which this may affect public confidence in the integrity of the Board or
            Committee and its decisions.

2.  Determining how to manage a conflict
    1.  There are three key components to management of a conflict of interest:
        -   Report.
        -   Resolve.
        -   Register.
    2.  Reporting a conflict of interest is required when an individual becomes aware they may have
        a conflict. When Board or committee members have a conflict of interest, the conflict is
        reported to the meeting members who will assess and make a determination as to how to best
        manage the conflict. Examples of conflicts of interest include:
        -   Purchasing goods or services supplied by the family business of a Board or committee
            member, relative or close friend.
        -   Participating in a tender for goods or services where a relative or friend will be
            submitting a tender.
        -   Directly negotiating for a friend or relative for them to provide goods or services to
            FIT for payment.
        -   Involvement in selection of a relative or friend to a FIT volunteer appointment.
        -   A volunteer voting on a decision which directly affects their private interests.
    3.  Resolving a conflict of interest can be achieved by the meeting members considering the
        following strategies and actions:
        -   **Restricting** the person with the conflict in the participation of decision making is
            an appropriate method where the conflict is not likely to arise frequently. Restriction
            could include:
            -   Withdrawing from discussion of the issue or proposal.
            -   Not participating in any critical criteria setting or decision making role.
            -   Abstaining from voting on the issue or proposal.
        -   **Recruiting** an independent person to oversee all or part of the process is an
            appropriate method where conflict is more significant and needs more proactive
            management, but the person with the conflict has specialist expertise and they cannot be
            easily replaced. Recruiting strategies include:
            -   Arranging for an independent third party to make the decision.
            -   Increasing the number of people sitting on the decision-making committee to balance
                any influence a single member may have.
            -   Seeking the views of those likely to be concerned about the conflict of interest and
                whether they object to the person with the conflict having any, or any further
                involvement.
        -   **Removing** the person with the conflict from the process is appropriate where there is
            ongoing serious conflict of interest and restriction or recruitment is not practical or
            feasible.  Strategies include:
            -   Removing the person with the conflict from any involvement.
            -   Abstaining from any formal or informal discussion about the matter.
            -   Separating the person with the conflict from the situation where there may be a
                perception of exerting a covert influence on decisions or actions.
        -   **Relinquishing** the private interest that gives rise to the conflict. Strategies
            include:
            - Divesting or withdrawing support for the private interest.
            - Assigning the conflict of interest to another arrangement for at least the duration of
              the conflict.
    4.  All conflicts of interest must be registered in the FIT Conflicts of Interest Register. This
        register provides transparency as to what conflicts have been declared and resolved.
    5.  The Secretary General is responsible for ensuring all conflicts of interest reported by
        Board and Committee members that are recorded in the meeting minutes are registered in the
        Conflict of Interests Register
    6.  As a minimum, the following information is to be recorded in the meeting minutes and
        Conflicts of Interests Register:
        -   Name of the person with the conflict of interest.
        -   Name of the person the conflict was reported to.
        -   A description of the interest and the conflict.
        -   Details of when it occurred or may occur.
        -   Details of whether the conflict is material and what the risk exposure is if not dealt
            with.
        -   How the matter was resolved and what action the Board or Committee has determined will
            be taken to manage the conflict.
        -   Where the Board or Committee member leaves the room during discussion and/or
            decision-making on the conflicted issue, the time that he/she leaves and returns, and
            the item (or part of the item) for which he/she was absent.

3.  Declaration of Private Interests
    1.  Prior to commencing as a Board or Committee member (or as soon as practicable thereafter) a
        Board or Committee member will lodge an up-to-date Declaration of Private Interests with the
        Board President or Committee Chair (Appendix 1).
    2.  All Board and Committee members will review their Declaration of Private Interests form
        annually.
    3.  In addition, a Board or Committee member will update his/her declaration if his/her
        circumstances change. Updated forms will be provided to the Board President or Committee
        Chair with records retained by the Secretary General.
    4.  The details of any interests identified in the Declaration of Private Interests are to be
        recorded in a Register of Private Interests maintained by the Secretary General. As a
        minimum, this register will detail:
        -   Name of the Board Member.
        -   Description of interest (e.g. sister-in-law co-owns a company which could potentially
            become a contractor to the organisation).
        -   Interested parties (e.g. sister-in-law).
        -   Is the interest current? (e.g. yes)

4.  Breaches of the Conflict of Interest policy
    1. Failure to disclose a conflict of interest is a breach of the [FIT Code of Behaviour Policy].
        It may result in the initiation of disciplinary action that could involve ceasing the
        person's involvement with FIT if deemed to be an incident of misconduct, wrongdoing or an
        abuse of power or authority. Refer to the [FIT Code of Behaviour Policy] and [FIT Member
        Protection Policy] for details as to how breaches are managed and disciplinary measures that
        may be taken.
