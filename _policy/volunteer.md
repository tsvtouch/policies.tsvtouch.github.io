        appropriately or where they believe their needs have not been adequately met.
    3.  There is an underlying assumption that complaints are made in good faith and with an
        intention to seek resolution (as opposed to retribution) and are not vexatious or malicious.

        careful attention to procedural fairness and the principles of natural justice.

        further consideration. Should the grievance not be resolved at the NTA/Region level, the
        matter may be referred to FIT in writing and addressed to the Secretary General.  The
        complaint should set out clearly the grounds of the grievance and any information to support
        that complaint.
    7.  On receipt of the written complaint the Secretary General shall consider the complaint and
        decide whether the complaint warrants investigation.
    8.  In the event the Secretary General decides that the complaint warrants investigation he/she
        shall inform the person against whom the complaint is made of the existence and particulars
        of the complaint and give him/her an opportunity to provide a response. The Secretary
        General shall undertake such investigation as he/she deems appropriate. Upon completion of
        the investigation the Secretary General shall decide whether any action is warranted and
        take any necessary steps to facilitate the implementation of any recommended action.
    9.  The Secretary General will confirm in writing to the complainant and the person(s) against
        whom the complaint was made the outcome of the investigation including any actions to be
        taken. This shall conclude the grievance process.
    10. At all times appropriate levels of confidentiality will be maintained.
    11. This policy excludes complaints regarding anti-discrimination, sexual harassment, bullying,
        and child protection matters which are managed through the [FIT Member Protection Policy].
