## Secretary General powers policy

1.  Responsibilities and powers of the Secretary General
    1.  The Secretary General has responsibility for ensuring resolution of disputes between
        Directors or between Committees. The Secretary General may not, however, direct any Director
        and any disputes must be resolved through discussion and agreement. In the event of a
        dispute arising between the Secretary General and another Director, or the Secretary General
        and the President, such disputes must be resolved under the direction of the full Board.
    2.  The Secretary General supports the President in providing leadership to the Board ensuring
        that decision making is participatory and democratic and provides leadership in dispute
        resolution.
    3.  The Secretary General, working with the President, must ensure consultative processes are
        followed in the formulation of FIT policy. The Secretary General also has an important role
        to play in initiating and contributing to policy through knowledge of FIT and its members'
        issues.
    4.  The Secretary General must ensure the Board, contractors and membership have the opportunity
        and the necessary information to contribute to FIT planning processes. The Secretary General
        must ensure that FIT has the opportunity and the necessary information to examine and ratify
        proposed plans and targets.
    5.  The Secretary General, through day to day contact with Directors and contractors, oversees
        the management of the Federation.
2.  FIT Commissions
    1.  The Secretary General is responsible for three FIT Commissions which fall within the
        Secretary General's portfolio:
        -   Policies Coordination Commission.
        -   Membership Recruitment Commission.
        -   Volunteer Commission.
3.  Board policy directives
    1.  The constitutional powers of the Secretary General are, pursuant to Rule 35.3 of the
        Constitution, subject to the policy directives of the Board.
    2.  The FIT Board specifically restricts the powers of the Secretary General as follows:
        -   The Secretary General cannot, without Board approval, take any action of constitutional,
            strategic and/or governance significance.
        -   The Secretary General cannot, without Board approval, take any action of financial
            significance, in particular, the Secretary General cannot seek to amend any financial
            related policy or offer any exceptions to such policies/decisions without Board
            approval.
        -   The Secretary General cannot, without Board approval, take any action of legal
            significance including, but not limited to:
            -   Entering into any contract, whether formal written contract, informal written and/or
                verbal agreements, or otherwise.
            -   Varying any contract, whether by formal written variation, informal written and/or
                verbal variations, or otherwise.
        -   If there is any doubt as to whether an issue involves a matter of constitutional,
            strategic, governance, financial and/or legal significance, the matter must be referred
            to the President for determination as to whether it is a matter for Board approval, or
            not.
        -   Any Board approval relating to matters of constitutional, strategic, governance,
            financial and/or legal significance must involve the President in the decision-making
            process, unless the President appoints a nominee to take his/her place in the relevant
            decision-making.
    3.  Notwithstanding Rule 35.1 of the Constitution, the Board determines that the legislative
        requirements of the Associations Incorporation Act 2009 (NSW) in relation to the Public
        Officer criteria, take precedence over the constitutional requirements, and so the Board has
        determined that it must:
        -   Appoint a NSW resident over 18 years of age as Public Officer of the Federation.
        -   Seek the NTA member's approval to amend the Constitution to provide for as flexible a
            compliance approach as possible with the legislative requirements in relation to the
            appointment of a Public Officer.
    4.  Notwithstanding Rule 35.4 of the Constitution, the Board determines that the Secretary
        General does not have the power to employ any personnel without Board approval (noting that
        employment involves matters of both legal and financial significance).
    5.  In relation to the general management and administrative duties the Secretary General must
        operate within the limits of FIT policy and common practice.
    6.  This description of powers serves to illustrate the scope and responsibilities of the
        position and is not intended to be an exhaustive list of duties. The Secretary General will
        be expected to perform other job related tasks requested by the Board and as necessitated by
        the development of this position and the ongoing development of FIT.
4.  Reporting
    1.  In accordance with the Constitution, Rule 35.2, the Secretary General must ensure a thorough
        report of activities undertaken by the Secretary General is presented to Board members at
        every meeting.
5.  Induction of an incoming Secretary General
    1.  Each time a Secretary General is elected, the outgoing Secretary General will be responsible
        for their induction. This will include responsibility for ensuring that the incoming office
        bearer is aware of the following:
        -   Any operational or strategic plans set by the Board.
        -   The details of any key or strategic priorities that are a focus for the role.
        -   Policies and sections of the Constitution which relate to the role of the Secretary
            General and those that pertain to Directors.
        -   The day to day administrative arrangements within FIT.
        -   The progress of ongoing initiatives, campaigns, lobbying or sponsorship activities.
