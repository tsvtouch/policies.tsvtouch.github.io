## Preface
{:.no_toc}

The Federation of International Touch (FIT), its National Touch Associations (NTAs) and affiliated
associations are committed to the health, safety and general well being of all its members. The
organisation is dedicated to providing a safe environment for members and providers participating in
any FIT activities.

The Member Protection Policy aims to inform members and the community that FIT seeks to prevent all
forms of harassment, discrimination and abuse and to promote positive behaviour and values.

Abuse, harassment or discrimination against members, by other members or an external source, is not
acceptable and will not be tolerated by FIT.  FIT, its NTAs and their affiliated associations have a
responsibility to provide safeguards to minimise member's exposure to abuse, harassment or
discrimination during their participation in FIT, its NTAs and their affiliated association's
activities.

FIT, its NTAs and their affiliated associations believe everyone who participates in its activities
has the right to be treated with respect and participate in a safe and productive environment. They
have the right to have their complaints addressed in a fair, equitable and confidential manner
according to the complaints procedures outlined in this policy, and that disciplinary action will be
taken against individuals if there is a breach of the policy.

# Part A: Member Protection Policy

## Introduction

FIT's Vision, Mission and values

-   FIT's Touch Mission Statement is to facilitate the development and expansion of Touch globally,
    and to be widely recognized and accepted as the international sporting organisation governing
    Touch.
-   Placing the sport in a position where biased thinking does not exist 
-   The sport's development and growth is as important as tending to an individual's needs.

## Purpose of this Policy

1.  This Member Protection Policy ("policy") aims to ensure the core values, good reputation,
    positive behaviours and attitudes of FIT, its NTAs and their affiliated associations are
    maintained and enhanced. It assists FIT, its NTAs and their affiliated associations to create
    and promote a safe, fair and inclusive environment for everyone associated with our sport. It
    sets out our commitment to ensure that every person bound by the policy is treated with respect
    and dignity and protected from discrimination, harassment and abuse. It also seeks to ensure
    that everyone involved in our sport is aware of their key legal and ethical rights and
    responsibilities, as well as the standards of behaviour expected of them.

    The attachments to this policy describe the practical steps we will take to eliminate
    discrimination, harassment, child abuse and other forms of inappropriate behaviour from our
    sport. As part of this commitment, the policy allows FIT, its NTAs and their affiliated
    associations to take disciplinary action against any person or organisation bound by this policy
    if they breach the policy.
    
    As FIT is an incorporated organisation registered in New South Wales, Australia, and its
    operations are governed by the legislative and regulatory requirements of the Commonwealth of
    Australia, and the State of New South Wales, this policy has been written using the guidelines
    and template provided by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC), Australian Government - ASC
    Member Protection Policy Template - National Version 9.1 (April 2016).
    
    This policy has been endorsed by the FIT Board and has been incorporated into our regulations*.*
    This policy and/or its attachments may be amended from time to time by resolution of FIT.
    
    Copies of this policy can be obtained from our website
    [www.internationaltouch.org](http://www.internationaltouch.org) and from the FIT office.
    Policies are subject to review and change at any time. In the event there has been change, the
    policy will be updated and members notified of such change.

2.  **An alternate policy** may be substituted for this policy where such alternate policy is
    required to be adopted by the NTA and its affiliated associations due to the requirements of any
    legislation and/or government sports agency that is relevant to that county and the NTA.

    In which case, the alternate policy shall apply to the organisations and individuals set out in
    [clause 2.1](#purpose-of-this-policy) above in relation to the activities of the NTAs and its
    affiliated associations provided that:

    1.  where this policy provides greater protection to such organisations and individuals, and
        such organisations and individuals are aggrieved that such protection does not apply under
        the alternate policy in relation to any incident, they may apply to FIT to implement the
        Informal Complaint Resolution Procedure in this policy which shall apply to the NTAs and its
        affiliated associations; and
    2.  where such organisations and/or individuals are involved in a FIT event (inclusive of but
        not limited to camps, training sessions, tournaments, meetings, etc) and there is a breach
        of this policy in relation to the FIT event, then this policy shall apply.

## Who is bound by this policy

This policy will apply to as many persons as possible who are involved with the activities of FIT
its NTAs and their affiliated associations whether they are in a paid or unpaid/voluntary capacity:

-   Support personnel, including managers, physiotherapists, psychologists, masseurs, sport trainers
    and others.
-   Coaches and assistant coaches.

-   NTAs and regions.
-   Affiliated associations and associated organisations.
-   Any other associations, such as Coaches Association, Players Association, etc.
-   Parents, Guardians, spectators and sponsors to the full extent that is possible.

employment with FIT if disciplinary action relating to an allegation of child abuse against that
person, has begun.

## Position statements

### Child protection

FIT is committed to the safety and well-being of all children and young people who participate in
our sport or access our services. We support the rights of the child and will act at all times to
ensure that a child-safe environment is maintained.

We acknowledge the valuable contribution made by our, members and volunteers and we encourage their
active participation in providing a safe, fair and inclusive environment for all participants.

#### Identify and analyse risk of harm

We will develop and implement a risk management strategy, including a review of our existing child
protection practices, to determine how child-safe our organisation is and to identify any additional
steps we can take to minimize and prevent the risk of harm to children because of the actions of an
employee, volunteer or another person.

#### Develop codes of behaviour

We will develop and promote a code of behaviour that sets out the conduct we expect of adults when
they deal and interact with children involved in our sport, especially those in our care. We will
also implement a code of behaviour to promote appropriate conduct between children.

These codes will clearly describe professional boundaries, ethical behaviour and unacceptable
behaviour. (Refer to the attachments in Part B of this policy.)

#### Choose suitable employees and volunteers

We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that our organisation engages suitable and appropriate
people to work with children, especially those in positions that involve regular unsupervised
contact with children. This will include using a range of screening measures.

We will ensure that Working with Children Checks are conducted for all employees and volunteers who
work with children, where an assessment is required by law. If a criminal history report is obtained
as part of their screening process, we will handle this information confidentially and in accordance
with the relevant legal requirements.  (Refer to the attachments in Part C of this policy.)

#### Support, train, supervise and enhance performance

We will ensure that all our employees and volunteers who work with children have ongoing
supervision, support and training. Our goal is to develop their skills and capacity and to enhance
their performance so we can maintain a child-safe environment in our sport.

#### Empower and promote the participation of children

We will encourage children and young people to be involved in developing and maintaining a
child-safe environment for our sport.

#### Report and respond appropriately to suspected abuse and neglect

We will endeavour to ensure that all our employees and volunteers are able to identify and respond
appropriately to children at risk of harm, and make a report if they suspect on reasonable grounds
that a child has been, or is being, abused or neglected. (Refer to the attachments in Part E of this
policy.)

Further, if any person believes that another person or organisation bound by this policy is acting
inappropriately towards a child, or is in breach of this policy, he or she may make an internal
complaint to us. (Refer to the attachments in Part D of this policy.)

### Taking images of children

There is a risk that Images of children may be used inappropriately or illegally. FIT requires that
individuals and associations, wherever possible, obtain permission from a child's parent/guardian
before taking an image of a child that is not their own. They should also make sure the
parent/guardian understands how the image will be used.

To respect people's privacy, we do not allow camera phones, videos and cameras to be used inside
changing areas, showers and toilets which we control or are used in connection with our sport.

When using a photo of a child, we will not name or identify the child or publish personal
information, such as residential address, email address or telephone number, without the consent of
the child's parent/guardian. We will not provide information about a child's hobbies, interests,
school or the like, as this can be used by paedophiles or other persons to "groom" a child.

We will only use images of children that are relevant to our sport and we will ensure that they are
suitably clothed in a manner that promotes participation in the sport. We will seek permission from
the parents/guardians of the children before using the images. We require our member associations
and associations to do likewise.

### Anti-discrimination and harassment

FIT is committed to providing an environment in which people are treated fairly and equitably and
that is, as far as practicable, free from all forms of discrimination and harassment.

We recognise that people may not be able to enjoy themselves or perform at their best if they are
treated unfairly, discriminated against or harassed.

#### Discrimination

Unlawful discrimination involves the less favourable treatment of a person on the basis of one or
more of the personal characteristics protected by International and NTAs laws

The personal characteristics protected by anti-discrimination laws include attributes such as race,
age, disability, gender and race. The full list of protected personal characteristics is in the
*Definitions* set out in the [Dictionary of Terms].

Discrimination can be either direct or indirect.

-   **Direct** discrimination occurs if a person treats, or proposes to treat, a person with a
    protected personal characteristic unfavourably because of that personal characteristic.
-   **Indirect** discrimination occurs if a person imposes, or proposes to impose, a requirement,
    condition or practice that will disadvantage a person with a protected personal characteristic
    and that requirement, condition or practice is not reasonable.

For the purposes of determining discrimination, the offender's awareness and motive are irrelevant.

#### Harassment

Harassment is any unwelcome conduct, verbal or physical, that intimidates, offends or humiliates
another person and which happens because a person has a certain personal characteristic protected by
FIT or its NTAs anti-discrimination legislation.

The offensive behaviour does not have to take place a number of times, a single incident can
constitute harassment.

Sexual harassment is one type of harassment. Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct, remarks or
innuendo of a sexual nature. It covers a wide range of behaviours and can be verbal, written, visual
or physical. Sexual harassment is not limited to members of the opposite sex.

#### Prohibition against discrimination and harassment

We prohibit all forms of harassment and discrimination based on the personal characteristics listed
in the "Definitions" set out in the [Dictionary of Terms].

Any person who believes they are being, or have been, harassed or discriminated against by another
person or organisation bound by this policy is encouraged to raise their concerns with us. A person
may make an internal complaint, and in some circumstances, they may also be able to make a complaint
to an external organisation. (Refer to the attachments in Part D of this policy.)

### Intimate relationships

FIT understands that consensual intimate relationships (including, but not limited to sexual
relationships) between coaches or officials and adult athletes may take place legally. However, this
policy will help ensure that the expectations of coaches or officials are clear and, to ensure that
if an intimate relationship does exist or develop between a coach or official and an adult athlete,
that relationship will be managed in an appropriate manner.

Coaches and officials are required to conduct themselves in a professional and appropriate manner in
all interactions with athletes.  In particular, they must ensure that they treat athletes in a
respectful and fair manner, and that they do not engage in sexual harassment, bullying, favoritism
or exploitation.

We take the position that consensual intimate relationships between coaches or officials and the
adult athletes they coach should be avoided as they can have harmful effects on the athlete
involved, on other athletes and coaches and on the sport's public image. These relationships can
also be perceived to be exploitative due to the differences in authority, power, maturity, status,
influence and dependence between the coach or official and the athlete.

We recommend that if an athlete attempts to initiate an intimate relationship with a coach or
official, the coach or official should discourage the athlete's approach and explain to the athlete
why such a relationship is not appropriate.

If a consensual intimate relationship does exist or develop between an adult athlete and a coach or
official, the coach or official is expected to ensure that the relationship is appropriate and that
it does not compromise impartiality, professional standards or the relationship of trust the coach
or official has with the athlete and/or other athletes.

In assessing the appropriateness of an intimate relationship between a coach or official and an
adult athlete, relevant factors include, but are not limited to:

-   the relative age and social maturity of the athlete;
-   any potential vulnerability of the athlete;
-   any financial and/or emotional dependence of the athlete on the coach or official;
-   the ability of the coach or official to influence the progress, outcomes or progression of the
    athlete's performance and/or career;
-   the extent of power imbalance between the athlete and coach or official; and  
    the likelihood of the relationship having an adverse impact on the athlete and/or other
    athletes.

It will often be difficult for a coach or official involved in an intimate relationship with an
adult athlete to make an objective assessment of its appropriateness and accordingly they are
encouraged to seek advice from an identified Member Protection Information Officer, Complaints
Manager or other official to ensure that they have not involved themselves in inappropriate or
unprofessional conduct.

If it is determined that an intimate relationship between a coach or official and an adult athlete
is inappropriate or unprofessional we may take disciplinary action against the coach or official up
to and including dismissal. Action may also be taken to stop the coaching relationship with the
athlete. This could include a transfer, a request for resignation or dismissal from coaching duties.

If a coach, official or athlete believes they are being, or have been, harassed they are encouraged
to seek information and support from the Member Protection Information Officer, Complaints Manager
or other official. Our complaints procedure is outlined in Part D of this policy.

### Pregnancy

FIT or its NTAs and their affiliated associations are committed to treating pregnant women fairly
and to removing any unreasonable barriers to their full participation in our sport. We will not
tolerate any discrimination or harassment against pregnant women.

FIT or its NTA and their affiliated associations will take reasonable care to ensure the continuing
safety, health and wellbeing of pregnant women. We will advise pregnant women that there may be
risks involved with their continuing participation in sport, and we will encourage them to obtain
medical advice about those risks. Pregnant women should be aware that their own health and
wellbeing, and that of their unborn child, is of utmost importance in their decision-making about
the extent they choose to participate in our sport.

We encourage all pregnant women to talk with their medical advisers, make themselves aware of the
facts about pregnancy in sport and ensure that they make informed decisions about their
participation in our sport. Pregnant women should make these decisions themselves, in consultation
with their medical advisers and in discussion with FIT or its NTAs and their affiliates

We will only require pregnant women to sign a disclaimer in relation to their participation in our
sport whilst they are pregnant if all other participants are required to sign one in similar
circumstances.  We will not require women to undertake a pregnancy test.

If a pregnant woman believes she is being, or has been, harassed or discriminated against by another
person or organisation bound by this policy, she may make a complaint. (Refer to the attachments in
Part D of this policy.)

### Gender identity

Gender identity means the gender-related identity, appearance or mannerisms or other gender-related
characteristics of a person. This includes the way people express or present their gender and
recognizes that a person's gender identity may be an identity other than male or female. Some terms
used to describe a person's gender identity include trans, transgender and gender diverse.

#### Gender identity discrimination and harassment

Anti-discrimination laws provide protection from discrimination against people on the basis of their
gender identity. (See definition in Dictionary of terms).

FIT is committed to providing a safe, fair and inclusive sporting environment all where people can
contribute and participate. We will not tolerate any unlawful discrimination or harassment of a
person because of their gender identity.

All persons, regardless of gender identity, are entitled to be treated fairly and with dignity and
respect at all times. We will not tolerate any unlawful discrimination or harassment of a person
because of their gender identity. This includes discrimination or harassment of a person who is
transgender or transsexual, who is assumed to be transgender or transsexual or has an association
with someone who has or is assumed to be transgender or transsexual. (Refer to the attachments in
Part D of this policy.)

We expect all people bound by this policy to act with sensitivity when a person is undergoing gender
transition/affirmation.

If any person believes that they are being, or have been, harassed or discriminated against by
another person or organisation bound by this policy because of their gender identity, they may make
a complaint.

#### Participation in sport

FIT recognizes that excluding people from participating in sporting events and activities because of
their gender identity may have significant implications for their health, wellbeing and involvement
in community life. We are committed to supporting participation in our sport on the basis of the
gender with which a person identifies.

If issues of performance advantage arise, we will consider whether the established discrimination
exceptions for participation in sport are relevant in the circumstances. Discrimination is unlawful
unless an exception applies.

Drug testing procedures and prohibitions also apply to people who identify as transgender. A person
receiving treatment involving a Prohibited Substance or Method, as described on the World
Anti-Doping Agency's Prohibited List, should apply for a standard Therapeutic Use Exemption.

#### Intersex status

FIT is committed to providing a safe, fair and inclusive sporting environment where all people can
contribute and participate. We will not tolerate any unlawful discrimination or harassment of a
person because of their intersex status.

### Responsible service and consumption of alcohol

FIT is committed to conducting sporting and social events in a manner that promotes the responsible
service and consumption of alcohol. We also recommend that NTAs and their affiliated Associations
follow strict guidelines regarding the service and consumption of alcohol.

In general, our policy is that:

-   alcohol should not be available or consumed at sporting events involving children and young
    people under the age of 18;
-   alcohol-free social events be provided for young people and families;
-   food and low-alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks be available at events we hold or endorse where
    alcohol is served;
-   a staff member is present at events we hold or endorse where alcohol is served to ensure
    appropriate practices in respect of the consumption of alcohol are followed;
-   safe transport options be promoted as part of any event we hold or endorse where alcohol is
    served.

### Smoke-free environment

FIT, its NTAs and their affiliated associations are committed to providing a safe and healthy
environment at all sporting and social events that it holds or endorses.

In general, our policy is that:

-   no smoking shall occur at or near sporting events involving children and young people under the
    age of 18. This policy shall apply to coaches, players, trainers, officials and volunteers;
-   social events shall be smoke-free, with smoking permitted at designated outdoor smoking areas;
    and
-   coaches, officials, trainers, volunteers and players will refrain from smoking while they are
    involved in an official capacity in our sport, both on and off the field.

### Bullying

FIT is committed to providing an environment that is free from bullying. We understand that bullying
has the potential to result in significant negative consequences for an individual's health and
wellbeing, and we regard bullying in all forms as unacceptable in our sport.

Bullying is characterized by repeated, unreasonable behaviour directed at a person, or group of
persons, that creates a risk to health and safety. Bullying behaviour is that which a reasonable
person in the circumstances would expect to victimise, humiliate, undermine, threaten, degrade,
offend or intimidate a person. Bullying behaviour can include actions of an individual or a group.

Whilst generally characterized by repeated behaviours, one-off instances can amount to bullying.

The following types of behaviour, where repeated or occurring as part of a pattern of behaviour,
would be considered bullying:

-   verbal abuse including shouting, swearing, teasing, making belittling remarks or persistent
    unjustified criticism;
-   excluding or isolating a group or person;
-   spreading malicious rumours; or
-   psychological harassment such as intimidation.

Bullying includes cyber-bulling which occurs through the use of technology. New technologies and
communication tools, such as smart phones and social networking websites, have greatly increased the
potential for people to be bullied though unwanted and inappropriate comments. FIT will not tolerate
abusive, discriminatory, intimidating or offensive statements being made online. Frustration at a
referee, teammate, coach or sporting body should never be communicated on social networking
websites. These issues should instead be addressed - in a written or verbal statement or a complaint
- to the relevant controlling club, league or peak sporting body.

If any person believes they are being, or have been, bullied by another person or organisation bound
by this policy, he or she may make a complaint. (Refer to the attachments in Part D of this policy.)

### Social networking

FIT acknowledges the enormous value of social networking to promote our sport and celebrate the
achievements and success of the people involved in our sport.

Social networking refers to any interactive website or technology that enables people to communicate
and/or share content via the internet.  This includes social networking websites such as Facebook
and Twitter.

We expect all people bound by this policy to conduct themselves appropriately when using social
networking sites to share information related to our sport.

In particular, social media activity including, but not limited to, postings, blogs, status updates,
and tweets:

-   must not contain material which is, or has the potential to be, offensive, aggressive,
    defamatory, threatening, discriminatory, obscene, profane, harassing, embarrassing,
    intimidating, sexually explicit, bullying, hateful, racist, sexist or otherwise inappropriate;
-   must not contain material which is inaccurate, misleading or fraudulent;
-   must not contain material which is in breach of laws, court orders, undertakings or contracts;
-   should respect and maintain the privacy of others; and
-   should promote the sport in a positive way.

## Complaints procedures

### Handling complaints

FIT aims to provide a simple, confidential and trustworthy procedure for resolving complaints based
on the principles of procedural fairness.

Any person (a complainant) may report a complaint about a person, people or organisation bound by
this policy (respondent) if they feel they have been discriminated against, harassed, bullied or
there has been any other breach of this policy.

In the first instance, complaints should be reported to the Member Protection Information Officer,
Complaints Manager, CEO or official of an NTA or competition organizer.

If a complaint relates to behaviour or an incident that occurred at the:

-   member level, or involves people operating at the member level, then the complaint should be
    reported to and handled by the relevant member association in the first instance
-   Affiliated association level, or involves people operating at the affiliated Club level, then
    the complaint should be reported to and handled by the relevant club in the first instance.

Only matters that relate to, or which occurred at, the international level, as well as serious cases
referred from the NTAs and association level, should be dealt with by the international body.\]

A complaint may be handled informally or formally. The complainant may indicate his or her preferred
option and the Member Protection Information Officer, Complaints Manager, CEO should consider
whether that is an appropriate way to handle the particular complaint.. For example, the law may
require that the complaint/allegation be reported to an appropriate authority.

All complaints will be dealt with promptly, seriously, sensitively and confidentially. Our
procedures for handling and resolving complaints are outlined in [Complaints procedure].

Individuals and organisations may also seek to have their complaint handled by an external agency
under anti-discrimination, child protection, criminal or other relevant legislation.

### Improper complaints and victimisation

FIT aims to ensure that our complaints procedure has integrity and is free of unfair repercussions
or victimisation against any person making a complaint.

We will take all necessary steps to make sure that people involved in a complaint are not
victimised. Disciplinary measures may be undertaken in respect of a person who harasses or
victimises another person for making a complaint or supporting another person's complaint.

If at any point in the complaint handling process the Member Protection Information Officer,
Complaints Manager, CEO considers that a complainant has knowingly made an untrue complaint, or the
complaint is malicious or inappropriately intended to cause distress to the respondent, the matter
may be referred in writing to FIT, its NTAs or their affiliated associations for review and
appropriate action, including possible disciplinary action against the complainant.

### Mediation

FIT aims to resolve complaints quickly and fairly. Complaints may be resolved by agreement between
the people involved with no need for disciplinary action.

Mediation is a confidential process that allows those involved in a complaint to discuss the issues
or incident in question and come up with mutually agreed solutions. It may occur before or after the
investigation of a complaint.

If a complainant wishes to resolve the complaint with the help of a mediator, the Member Protection
Information Officer, Complaints Manger CEO will, in consultation with the complainant, arrange for
an independent mediator where possible. We will not allow lawyers to negotiate on behalf of the
complainant and/or the respondent in the mediation process.

More information on the mediation process is outlined in [Mediation].

### Tribunals

In accordance with the FIT's rules a Tribunal may be convened to hear a proceeding:

-   Referred to it by CEO or other designated official.
-   Referred to it or escalated by a National association because of the serious nature of the
    complaint, because it was unable to be resolved at the NTA level or because the policy of the
    NTA directs it to be.
-   For an alleged breach of this policy.

Our Tribunal procedure is outlined in [Tribunal procedures].

A respondent may lodge an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal in respect of a Tribunal decision. The
decision of the Appeal Tribunal is final and binding on the people involved. Our appeals process is
outlined in [Tribunal procedures].

Every organisation bound by this policy will recognize and enforce any decision of a Tribunal or
Appeal Tribunal under this policy.

6.  any other form of discipline that the national body or peak organisation considers reasonable
    and appropriate.

### Factors to consider

The form of discipline to be imposed on an individual or organisation will depend on factors, such
as:

-   the nature and seriousness of the breach
-   if the person knew, or should have known, that the behaviour was a breach of the policy
-   the person's level of contrition
-   the effect of the proposed disciplinary measures on the person, including any personal,
    professional or financial consequences
-   if there have been any relevant prior warnings or disciplinary action
-   the ability to enforce disciplinary measures if the person is a parent or spectator (even if
    they are bound by the policy)
-   any other mitigating circumstances.

# Part C: Employment/appointment screening / working with children check requirements

We are committed to providing a safe environment for children. As part of this, we will recruit
staff and volunteers who do not pose a risk to children.

Employment/appointment screening and Working with Children Checks can involve criminal history
checks, signed declarations, referee checks and other appropriate checks that assess a person's
suitability to work with children and young people.

Working with Children Check laws are currently in place in numerous NTAs.

requirements of the relevant NTAs where an event is being held.

Individuals travelling with children and young people to another NTA in any related capacity must
comply with the screening requirements of that particular NTA as well as the NTA of origin.
