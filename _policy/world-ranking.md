# FIT World Ranking Policy

## Purpose of policy

The purpose of this policy is to provide FIT with a means of determining the relative strength of a
Member NTA in each recognised division.

## Policy scope and application

The policy applies to all teams representing an NTA in a recognised division of a Tier 1-3 event.

Matches played since 28th April 2015 (the commencement of the Touch World Cup hosted by Austraila
in Coffs Harbour) will be considered in calculating ranking points. *This clause becomes unnecessary
from 29th April 2019 when ranking points will decay to zero value.*

## Definitions

Average
:   the number calculated by dividing the sum of the values in a set by the number of values in
    the set

Decay
:   a gradual decrease applied to ranking points over time to place greater importance on more
    recent results

Factor
:   a fact or circumstance that contributes to the calculation of ranking points per match

NTA
:   National Touch Association

Round robin
:   a tournament in which each competitor plays in turn against every other

Subdivision
:   a second order group of teams following progression from initially seeded pools

Variable
:   a quantity which during calculation of ranking points varies in value per match

## Regulatory background

## Policy statement

FIT is committed to encouraging, rewarding and acknowledging the results of international
competition.

## FIT world ranking policy

### Factors

Every match played between two NTA's in a Tier 1-3 event will contribute to that nation's ranking
score.

The individual factors that may influence rank are:

-   whether the match played resulted in a win, loss, or draw for the team
-   the margin between the scores of the opposing teams
-   the elapsed time since the match took place - ranking points decay over time
-   the importance of the match - Tier 1 events as opposed to Tier 2 and Tier 3 events

### Variables

The above factors are translated to variables with values determined according to the rules below:

-   `RESULT`
    -   15 points for a win
    -   10 points for a draw
    -   5 points for a loss
    -   -20 points for losing by forfeit
-   `MARGIN BONUS`
    -   2 × win points for a winning margin > 15 touchdowns; or
    -   1 × win points for a winning margin > 10 touchdowns; or
    -   ½ × win points for a winning margin > 5 touchdowns; or
    -   ½ × loss points for a losing margin < 2 touchdowns
-   `DECAY`
    -   1 × multiplier for matches played in the last 12 months
    -   ⅞ × multiplier for matches played between 24 and 12 months ago
    -   ⅝ × multiplier for matches played between 36 and 24 months ago
    -   ⅜ × multiplier for matches played between 48 and 36 months ago
-   `IMPORTANCE`
    -   5 × multiplier for Tier 1 events
        -   1 × multiplier for first subdivision
        -   ⅖ × multiplier for second subdivision
        -   ⅕ × multiplier for subsequent subdivisions
    -   2 × multiplier for Tier 2 events
    -   1 × multiplier for Tier 3 events

### Calculation

For every match the following is calculated.

    (RESULT + MARGIN BONUS) * IMPORTANCE * DECAY

This results in a series which is then averaged. The average is the *ranking points* of the team.

Forfeits are excluded for teams who win by forfeit -- including them would adversly impact their
average.

All teams who have a positive *ranking points* value are sorted in descending order. The team with
the highest number of *ranking points* at a given point in time is deemed to be the number one
ranked team in the world, and so on and so forth.

### Publication

The world rankings for every recognised division will be published on the first day of every month,
except when there is a Tier 1-3 event in progress -- on these occassions the rankings will be
published the day following the conclusion of the event.
